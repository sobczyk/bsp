FDI startup code and bootloaders

This BSP includes startup code and boot loaders to startup up the
FDI3250 board. The startup code initializes the board, sets up system
clocking, initializes SDRAM and then launches a C application.

The startup code is broken into the following pieces:
	System startup code
	kickstart loader
	Stage 1 Loader (S1L)

Also included is a burner application for burning the kickstart and
stage 1 Loader boot appplications.

The FDI3250 boots from large block NAND FLASH using a 2 step process.
The LPC3250 runs from it's internal boot ROM on system reset. It will
boot the kickstart loader from block 0 of NAND FLASH by loading the
kickstart image into IRAM at address 0x0 and then tranferring
cnotrol the loaded image. The kickstart loader initializes GPIOs,
COPU and bus clocks, SDRAM, and other chip and board functions. It
then loads the S1L application from NAND block 1 and on into IRAM
just past the kickstart loader. After S1L is loaded, control is then
transferred to S1L.
