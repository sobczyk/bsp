LPC3250 Board Pupport Package

Default makefiles work for windows only.
After some fixes the makefiles may work on linux, although CMake is preffered.

Out of source build is preferred:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../toolchain_arm.cmake ..
make


One has to have the proper arm toolchain in PATH;
currently arm-linux- is set
can be changed in toolchain_arm.cmake


Working:
- build Kickstart with .bin
- build s1l with .bin
- ONLY FDI3250 dev board

TODO:

- build burners
- add custom board
